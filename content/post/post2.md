Continuous Integration is the process by which developers make commits to the project's main source code repository (usually the master branch). At the same time, the quality of the code is ensured through automated testing.
Continuous deployment is the frequent automated deployment of code to production. The second part of the abbreviation CI / CD is sometimes revealed as "continuous delivery" ("continuous delivery"). This is basically the same as "continuous deployment", but "continuous delivery" implies that changes must be manually confirmed before starting the project deployment process.

Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) is an agile methodology used by many organizations. It helps them deliver their software efficiently and securely.
According to the GitLab 2020 DevSecOps survey, almost 83% of developers are releasing code faster and more frequently, and 59% of companies are releasing multiple releases per day. This is due to the introduction of DevOps methodologies and, first of all, continuous integration, automated testing and continuous software deployment.
Each organization tries to somehow find this perfect balance and use its own methodologies, which are usually called "best practices", when creating their own CI / CD pipeline. Let's take a look at some basic principles for an efficient and secure CI/CD pipeline.
