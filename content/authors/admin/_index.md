I have gone through a rather difficult path over the past 2 years: re-entering the university, my first job and meeting new people dear to me; in order to eventually come to what I am doing now, namely: I am studying in the direction I have chosen, making my first website in my life, in order to create something much more ambitious and useful in the future.
