The word "presentation", although it sounds fashionable and loud, actually (in most cases) implies a document of several sheets (slides) with text and graphic information (something like wall newspapers that were in use 20-25 years ago, before the popularity of the PC).

The main goal is to demonstrate clearly and briefly the results of their work, to convey basic information to the audience, to present a project. ðŸ‘€

Difficulties with its creation usually arise for those users who have never encountered this issue before. In fact, if you start making a presentation step by step (gradually dealing with each element), then everything is quite simple, and even a completely novice user can do it.
