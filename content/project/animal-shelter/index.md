My boyfriend and I decided to do charity work and help an animal shelter. We got a kitten 7 months ago and recently she had surgery. She suffered it quite hard, it was very painful to look at. Therefore, we decided to make life easier for other animals by helping the shelter.
I made a picture with data about the shelter and fundraising so that people could transfer money to the shelter's account or come there in person. To attract people, we placed a fundraising glass and a picture with the details next to the cash register at a friend's fresh bar. People come for quite expensive cocktails and obviously will not spare money to help animals. I also plan to create a website to help the shelter and a YouTube channel to attract more people and document our actions and assistance.
